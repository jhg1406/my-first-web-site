<h2>Soccer</h2>
   <p>
      <strong> <span class="main">A ball sport</span> in which points are scored by hitting the ball into the opponent's goal using the feet rather than touching the ball with the hands or arms, and <u>the winner or loser is determined by the superiority or inferiority of the score.</strong></u>

        Sports in which touching the ball with one's hands or arms is prohibited and that use a goalpost are classified as soccer or a subspecies of soccer. In other words, if not, it is classified as a separate item.
