      <strong><u>It is one of the <span class="main">ball sports</span> where points are scored by putting the ball into the ring (rim), and the player with the higher score by one point by scoring within the time limit wins.</u> Five players are selected per team. It is mainly played in two halves or four quarters, with each half being 20 minutes each for a total of 40 minutes, and the fourth quarter being 10 minutes per quarter, a total of 40 minutes.</strong>

        A variation of the sport is 3X3 basketball, which is played in half court with a single goal. Also known as street basketball or street ball. Additionally, netball, a women-only ball game, was derived from basketball in the late 19th century.
