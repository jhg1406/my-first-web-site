<h2>Origins of the olympics</h2>
   <p>
      <strong><u>The Olympiad</u> originated as a kind of religious event dedicated to Zeus</strong>, the absolute god of the ancient Greeks, and because it was held in Olympia on the western coast of the Peloponnese peninsula, it was called the Olympics after him.
