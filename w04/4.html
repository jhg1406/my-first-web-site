<h2>Basketball</h2>
   <p>
      <strong><u>It is one of the ball games where points are scored by putting the ball into the ring (rim), and the player with the higher score by one point by scoring within the time limit wins.</u> Five players are selected per team. It is mainly played in two halves or four quarters, with each half being 20 minutes each for a total of 40 minutes, and the fourth quarter being 10 minutes per quarter, a total of 40 minutes.</strong>

        A variation of the sport is 3X3 basketball, which is played in half court with a single goal. Also known as street basketball or street ball. Additionally, netball, a women-only ball game, was derived from basketball in the late 19th century.
