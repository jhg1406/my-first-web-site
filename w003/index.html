width="100%" alt="html image">
<p>A ball sport in which points are scored by hitting the ball into the opponent's goal using the feet rather than touching the ball with the hands or arms, and the winner or loser is determined by the superiority or inferiority of the score.</p>

<p>Touching the ball with your hands or arms is prohibited[4], and sports that use a goalpost are classified as soccer or a subspecies of soccer[5]. In other words, if not, it is classified as a separate item.</p>
